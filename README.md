## Hello!

I'm a **third-year MSc student in Engineering Physics** at **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}** with a strong interest in  
**scientific computing, applied mathematics, and data-driven methods**.

This GitHub profile is where I upload:
- 📘 **Coursework & assignments** from engineering physics and applied mathematics courses  
- 🧪 **Numerical & computational projects** (PDEs, simulations, algorithms)  
- 🚀 **Hackathon code & prototypes**  
- 🔧 **Personal projects** exploring ideas beyond coursework  

---

### 🔬 Current focus
- Numerical methods for PDEs & scientific computing  
- Computational physics & simulations  
- Data analysis, algorithms, and machine learning  
- Writing clean, reproducible research code  

---

### 📂 What you’ll find here
- **Course repositories** – structured solutions, reports, and implementations  
- **Hackathons** – fast-paced problem solving and experimental ideas  
- **Side projects** – tools, experiments, and concepts I wanted to try out  

Most repositories are documented with the intent that others (and future me 😄) can follow the reasoning and methods.

---

### 🛠 Tech I frequently use
- **Languages:** Python, MATLAB, C/C++  
- **Tools:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, LaTeX, Git  
- **Focus:** numerical stability, performance, and clarity  

---

### 🤝 Collaboration
I’m always happy to:
- Discuss numerical methods or computational physics  
- Collaborate on scientific or data-driven projects  
- Exchange ideas from hackathons or research problems
